It begins here: http://tour.golang.org/

This project is an attempt at learning the Go programming
language. Here's the tentative plan:

1. Complete the golang tutorial as given above.
2. Review the effective go guide.
3. Implement a simple project and commit it here.
4. Commence a more complicated project on a separate repository.

The code examples presented here are largely clones of what is available
in the gotour tutorial. Only occasionally do I deviate from their source,
and I do so where my own instincts tell me to do so - globals make me
uncomfortable even in example programs!
